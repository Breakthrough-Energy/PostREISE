# PostREISE
**PostREISE** is part of a Python software ecosystem developed by [Breakthrough
Energy Sciences](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/) to carry out power flow study
in the U.S. electrical grid.


## Main Features
Here are a few things that **PostREISE** can do:
* Perform transmission congestion/utilization analyses of scenarios
* Study generation/emission in scenarios
* Plot results of analyses

A detailed tutorial can be found on our [docs].


## Where to get it
* Clone or Fork the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/PostREISE)
* Get latest release from PyPi: `pip install postreise`


## Dependencies
**PostREISE** relies on:
* **PowerSimData**, another package developed by Breakthrough Energy Sciences and
available [here][PowerSimData]. You must have **PowerSimData** cloned in a folder
adjacent to your clone of **PostREISE** as the installation of packages depends on
files in **PowerSimData**.
* Several Python packages all available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) whose list can be
found in the ***requirements.txt*** or ***Pipfile*** files both located at the root of
this package.


## Installation
Scenario data managed by **PowerSimData** are used by the analysis and plotting modules
of **PostREISE**. Follow the instructions in the README of the [PowerSimData] package to install our
software ecosystem.


## License
[MIT](LICENSE)


## Documentation
[Code documentation][docstrings] in form of Python docstrings along with an overview of
the [package][docs] are available on our [website][website].


## Communication Channels
[Sign up](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/#get-updates) to our email list and
our Slack workspace to get in touch with us.


## Contributing
All contributions (bug report, documentation, feature development, etc.) are welcome. An
overview on how to contribute to this project can be found in our [Contribution
Guide](https://breakthrough-energy.github.io/docs/dev/contribution_guide.html).
