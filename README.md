# PostREISE
---

## 1. Setup/Install
This package requires MATLAB and WesternInterconnectNetwork.

### A. MATLAB
Install MATLAB and proceed as follows
```
cd "matlabroot\extern\engines\python"
python setup.py install
```
for Windows system.
```
cd "matlabroot/extern/engines/python"
python setup.py install
```
for Mac or Linux systems.


### B. WesternInterconnectNetwork
In the WesternInterconnect package, locate the ***setup.py*** file and type: `pip3 install .` Do not forget to update your PYTHONPATH environment variable.


### C. PostREISE
In the PostREISE package, locate the ***setup.py*** file and type: `pip3 install .` Do not forget to update your PYTHONPATH environment variable.



## 2. Extract Data
The aim of the `postreise.extract.extract_data` module is three fold:
* locate the outputs of the simulation;
* extract the results from the MATLAB files and;
* save the data in csv files.



## 3. Transfer Data
Simulation output data are located on the server. These can be easily transferred to your local machine using the `postreise.procees.transferdata` module.

First, create a `OutputData` instance. Note that the path to the local folder where the data will be stored can be specified. If no location is specified the data will be stored in a *scenario_data* folder in home.

Then, call the `get_data` method with the scenario name along with the type of data (PG or PF) as arguments. The call to the function is illustrated below:
```python
from postreise.process.transferdata import OutputData
od = OutputData()
PGtest = od.get_data('western_scenarioUnitTest02', 'PG')
PFtest = od.get_data('western_scenarioUnitTest02', 'PF')
```


## 4. Analyze
The `postreise.analyze` module encloses the congestion analysis.



## 5. Plot
The `postreise.plot.analyze_pg` module is dedicated to the analysis of the PG (Power Generated) output file. There are currently 7 analysis implemented:
* Time series of power generated and demand in one zone. The contribution of the different resources is broken down by colors.
* Time series of the power generated for one resource in multiple zones.
* Time series of the curtailment for one renewable resource in one zone.
* Calculate statistical relationships (correlation coefficients) between the power generated in two zones for one resource. Correlation matrix is used to display results.
* Calculate the proportion of resources and generation per resources in one zone. Bar charts are used for display.
* Time series of power generated in one zone for one resource. Also superimpose the time series of the power generated by 2, 8 and 15 randomly chosen plants in the same zone and using the same resource.
* Calculate the capacity factor of one resource in one zone and show result using box plots.

Check out the notebooks within the [demo](https://github.com/intvenlab/PostREISE/tree/addAnalyzeAndPlot/postreise/plot/demo/) folder for demo.

The `postreise.plot.analyze_set` module accomplishes a similar job for a set of scenario. The [october_meeting](https://github.com/intvenlab/PostREISE/tree/addAnalyzeAndPlot/postreise/plot/demo/october_meeting.ipynb) Jupyter notebook illustrates the plot routines implemented.
